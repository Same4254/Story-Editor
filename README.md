# Story-Editor

## Planned Features
* Character sheet to include images of characters in the story and their description / backstory.
* Comment Highlighting, much like in Google Docs
* Developer panel. This would be a sheet that would be next to you will you're typing a chapter. This would something you fill out before writing and can look at in the middle of writing to remind youself what a chapter is meant to be about. What key elements did you want to hit, possible quotes from the characters, etc...
* Paragraph Revisor. Let's say you are playing and tweaking with different revisions of a paragraph. Instead of having to copy and paste it over and over, this program will allow you to cycle through the different versions in with the click of an arrow button. 
* Blur mode. Maybe you want to focus purely one one segment. This program will blur out all text except for the segment you wish to focus on.
* Element / Flow View. This program will allow you to layout a flowchart of each chapter, if you choose so.
* Paint Mode. There is something about making hand writing marks on a paper that makes it much more personal and thorough than on the screen. This mode will allow you to draw onto an image of the text. (best done with a touch screen)
* Revision Manager. Writers go through many revisions, how about let the program keep track for you?
* Fully customizable background. Would you rather have a white sheet of paper or parchment be the background paper? Your choice.
